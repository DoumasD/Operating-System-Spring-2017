# Demetrios Doumas Spring 2017

# Project Name: Operating Systems Lab Assignments

# Description:

Table of Contents:

1.) Task One: File Management System Calls

2.) Task Two: Process Management System Calls

3.) Task Three: Process Management System Calls part two

4.) Task Four: System Calls Summary Problem Average Grade Calculator

5.) Task Five: Dad-Son Problem

6.) Task Six: Cigarette Smokers Problem


Note: Each task has its own README file.


# What I learned:

1.) Task One: How to create, open, read, write, and close a file.

2.) Task Two: What is a parent process and a child process. How to use fork() and other related process system calls.

3.) Task Three: How to create a child process to run its own program. Created a parent process that had two children. The first created two files. The second child wrote to those files.

4.) Task Four: Used the knowledge of the last three task to solve the Problem called Average Grade calculator.

5.) Task Five: Learned about semaphores, and critical sections.

6.) Task Six: Learned how to sync processes with two different implementations. One implementation uses semaphores with fork() and the other uses threading with mutex_lock.
